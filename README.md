# masayloBlocklyLinux
Not an official working repository, but a tool to organize myself. Today, I've succeeded in make MasayloBlockly work in Ubuntu x64, but I have had to modify many files, so, it's not (yet) the same code as windows. So, I'll use this repository to have two different ways of maintaining both codes. Period.
